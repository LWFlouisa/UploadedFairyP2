<h2>Nouns Of French Origin</h2>

<p>In this hyper evolved version of Fraponic, Ne and Pas has been switched to Ne and Pesa. But continues to be incorportated into the word itself.</p>

<p>Ex. Xatapesa or Nexata.</p>

<h2>Japanese Negation</h2>

<p>This hyper evolved version of Fraponic continues to follow the previous Japanese language negation method: words will be negated by the term Na, with their spelling adjusted to include this word. All sentence based negative is thus rendered as a double negative. That word is Na:</p>

<p>Ex. Os Sunamos, Os Nesunamos</p>

<h2>Hybrid Negation</h2>

<p>Nix is used for hybrid negation. This can also be used for German loan words, that used Nicht as negative rather than Ne or Ni. Nix is incorporated into the word itself.</p>

<p>Ex. Os nixosicohonosunamos.</p>

<p>( Not pig tsunamis. )</p>
